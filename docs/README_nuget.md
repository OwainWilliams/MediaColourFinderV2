With this Umbraco CMS package, you can now add a new custom property editor to your uploaded images. This feature enables you to use the focal point of an image to obtain its brightest color, average color, and opposite color to the brightest.

You can then use these colours in your website build to enhance your designs.

This is a community package and is not officially supported by Umbraco.

This package is a successor to the original [Media Colour Finder](https://github.com/WildSiteCreations/Our.Community.MediaColourFinder) and is built for Umbraco V15+
